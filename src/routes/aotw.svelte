    <p>
      Formed in Japan in the late 60s, Les Rallizes DéNudés hadn't actually
      heard any rock music before, but were basing their sound on what they
      thought it would sound like after reading descriptions of the work of
      American artists like Hendrix and Zeppelin. It may take a few listens to
      break through the thick walls of meandering guitar noise, hypnotic bass
      lines, and psychedelic lofi production &mdash; which often teeters on the
      edge of unhinged &mdash; but it's ultimately more than worth it.

      <h3>ESG</h3>
      <h2>
        Come Away With ESG
        <span class="release-year">(1983)</span>
      </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      ESG enters the scene with a bang on their debut release, showcasing their
      unique blend of infectious vocal lines and a groovy-as-hell rhythmic
      section. The Scroggins sisters take a minimalist approach to dance punk,
      and each instrument feels supremely significant. In fact, labeling it
      "dance punk" is doing a disservice to the songs on this album.
      <i>Come Away With ESG</i>
      absolutely demands dancing, and at the same time makes all other dance
      music sound corny in comparison.

      <h3>Gallon Drunk</h3>
      <h2>
        You, The Night... and The Music
        <span class="release-year">(1992)</span>
      </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      The perfect backdrop for an unruly Tuesday night at the dingy dive bar:
      the air is punctuated by an unmistakable hint of stale beer and mildew,
      some crust punk is bumbling around polishing off people's empties, and the
      door has been ripped off the only bathroom stall you can shit in. Gallon
      Drunk wears their Birthday Party influence proudly on their sleeve, but
      manages to make their brand of noisy swamp blues sound convincingly
      surreal.
