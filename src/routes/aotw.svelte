			<h3>Les Rallizes DéNudés</h3>
			<h2>Cable Hogue Soundtrack
				<span class="release-year">(rec. 1971-1979, bootlegged 2007)</span>
			</h2>
		</div>

		<p>Formed in Japan in the late 60s, Les Rallizes DéNudés hadn't actually heard any rock music before, but were basing their sound on what they thought it would sound like after reading descriptions of the work of American artists like Hendrix and Zeppelin. It may take a few listens to break through the thick walls of meandering guitar noise, hypnotic bass lines, and psychedelic lofi production &mdash; which often teeters on the edge of unhinged &mdash; but it's ultimately more than worth it.</p>

			<h3>ESG</h3>
			<h2>Come Away With ESG
				<span class="release-year">(1983)</span>
			</h2>
		</div>

		<p>ESG enters the scene with a bang on their debut release, showcasing their unique blend of infectious vocal lines and a groovy-as-hell rhythmic section. The Scroggins sisters take a minimalist approach to dance punk, and each instrument feels supremely significant. In fact, labeling it "dance punk" is doing a disservice to the songs on this album. <i>Come Away With ESG</i> absolutely demands dancing, yet at the same time makes all other dance music sound corny in comparison.</p>

			<h3>Gallon Drunk</h3>
			<h2>You, The Night... and The Music
				<span class="release-year">(1992)</span>
			</h2>
		</div>

		<p>The perfect backdrop for an unruly Tuesday night at the dingy dive bar: the air is punctuated by an unmistakable hint of stale beer and mildew, some crust punk is bumbling around polishing off people's empties, and the door has been ripped off the only bathroom stall you can shit in. Gallon Drunk wears their Birthday Party influence proudly on their sleeve, but manages to make their brand of noisy swamp blues sound convincingly surreal.</p>
