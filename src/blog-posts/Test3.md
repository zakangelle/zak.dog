There's nothing better than jacket weather â€” the cold makes me feel alive. Last night I got the best sleep I've gotten in months. I almost forgot what it feels like to operate on sufficient rest.

Skipped my afternoon meetings to grab some last minute Halloween costume supplies. Still gotta put the finishing touches on it tomorrow, but it's coming together.

Picked up Boosh after work and went to REI to get a few things for the camping trip this weekend. The REI dude kept trying to upsell Boosh on various utensils and offensively turquoise dinnerware. He succumbed initially but after taking an abridged version of the Zak Masterclass on Resisting and Rejecting the Capitalist REI Machine, he came to his senses and made a sane purchase in the end.

After dodging the money-hungry co-op vultures, we stopped at a steakhouse down the street to flex on local passerbys. We capped off the night with a chilly 3-mile walk around campus and a hot jasmine green tea, presumably laced with 6 pounds of Imperial Sugar.

Beanie gang assemble.
