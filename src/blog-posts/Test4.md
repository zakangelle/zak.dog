Several times throughout the day, without a second thought, I picked up my new flip phone and just stared blankly into it. Almost like I was expecting something to happen. Peering fervently into an empty well, waiting for it to quench my thirst.

No endlessly refreshable content feeds.

No passive notifications to occupy and sedate my overactive mind.

Just my own thoughts and a hunk of primitive technology that offers nothing more than a mirror into my own anxiety.

It seems only logical that the first day of a challenge like this would be the toughest, but I have a feeling it will only get more difficult from here. These first few weeks are just a honeymoon. When the novelty wears off, the real challenge begins.

Until then, I'm taking it a day at a time.
