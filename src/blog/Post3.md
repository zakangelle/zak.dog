A lot has changed in the last 100 days.

The 90-day dumbphone challenge came to a quiet and successful ending two weeks ago, and I've decided to continue the pursuit of anti-distraction indefinitely.

What once felt like a major inconvenience is now a minor obstacle, and I've continued to cut other toxic dependencies from my life for the sake of both productivity and moral principle.

Netflix. YouTube. Google. Amazon. PayPal. Venmo. All gone.

And this is just the beginning.

I've spent years condemning these things yet have continued to be an active and paying participant of their platforms. I've constructed a personal ethos and recklessly disregarded it on a daily basis. I've been fake, I've been a hypocrite, and in many ways, I continue to be those things.

I got caught up in the rat race and lost my sense of self.

From now on, I will strive to rise above the bullshit. To actively and deliberately rebel against it. To resist being pacified by modern-day amenities and to stay true to my ideology, even if it means taking the longer and more treacherous road to arrive at the same outcome.

This is just the beginning.
