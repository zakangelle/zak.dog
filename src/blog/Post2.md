Free. Light. Unbound.

There's a tangible disconnect from the frenetic happenings of the world around me. I feel present. Like some switch in the breaker box of my brain was flipped and my perspective was reset to a clean initial state.

It's only been three days, and it's already hard to remember what it was like before this. I've woken up from a deep slumber; returned from a place where my mind was chained, stuck in some infinitely repeating compulsion loop.

**My mind**: the naive creator and willing participant to its own prison.

Science fiction has long envisioned a future where human beings and technology merge seamlessly into a singular organism, the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Where the line blurs between biological disposition and technological compensation.

Here's the thing: humans are **_already_** cybernetic organisms, but the technology isn't embedded in us.

**_We_** are embedded in **_it_**.
